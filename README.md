I will be creating a small database using PostgreSQL and a graphical adminitrative tool called pgAdmin.
pgAdmin is a visual workspace for managing the PostgreSQL database. It is used to see your database objects,
manage settings, import/export data, write your queries.
Code is provided to show you my attributes (columns) and values (rows) as well as the types of queries I ran on the database. 
The database is called 'analysis' and the table name is 'teachers'.
Code can be found within the teachers.sql file
